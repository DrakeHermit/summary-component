## My process

I started with planning how to organize my code in react. After I finally came up with my folder structure I started by writing the components and the css for each component. After finishing the mobile design I moved onto the tablet and desktop design which is the same.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned how to structure my react project, is it perfect I don't think so but I tried my best to make it somewhat logical. I also made a folder for utility functions and honestly that is probably the highlight of this project since it was pretty simple. The hardest part was figuring out how I should structure it in react.

### Continued development

My plan is to go over the whole path and become proficient in using react. Adding tailwind and ts is the next logical thing beyond learning the core concepts of react.
